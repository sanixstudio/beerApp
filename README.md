A simple beer application created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript. It makes an API call to https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers and returns the result with different kinds of beers with their ABV and IBU levels respectively. Users can filter through fetched beer results and apply filters like Beer Alcohol and Hoppiness to the results.
